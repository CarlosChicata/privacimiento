# Privacimiento: project

## Purpose
This is a portfolio contains all my ideas associated privacy and security of data: projects/PoC, theoretic concepts, experiments, comparative and others.

## List of portfolio cases

This is my portfolio projects i built it based in this case.

| NÂ° of Case | Title | Short description | Topics | skills | Input | Outputs | Status |
|------------|-------|-------------------|--------|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Classification of data in mandalo: operational data using GDPR | Classify privacy based data in operational area of "mandalo" startup based in GDPR. | `Classification data` | `Classification data`, `Understanding law`, `GDPR` | All case operational in mandalo startup. | `Data classification document`, `Decision and understanding document` | `Wait to start` |
| 2 | Structure of role in mandalo | Create a recommendations to structure the role to access and authorize operations. It's based in mandalo startup. | `Access data management`, `Authorization data management` | `Understand requirements`, `Role structure`, `Access management` | All case operational in mandalo startup. | `Data model`, `Access and authorization management model` | `Wait to start` |
| 3 | Model a structure of role in mandalo | Implement a data model (logical and conceptual) to reflect a recomendation of role structure in mandalo startup. | `Data modeling` | `Conceptual data model`, `Logical data model`, `Understand business requirements` | case 2 | `Conceptual data model`, `Logical data model` | `Wait to start` |
| 4 | Define lifecycle data in operational area: design and define | Design lifecycle of data to moving of data based in usage and privacy focuses. This is for operational area in mandalo startup. | `Data lifecycle`, `Requirements of usage`, `Data arquitecture modeling`, `Data sharing` | `Design privacy lifecycle data`, `Data arquitecture modeling`,  `Data modeling`, `Transformation data` | All case operational in mandalo startup.  | `Data arquitecture modeling`, `workflow diagram`, `data standards` | `Wait to start` |
| 5 | Create a SQL enviroment to share data: define and design | Design and define a project be access by external partner to get their data based in self-service enviroment. This is used in mandalo startup. | `Data sharing`, `Access policy management`, `Data anonimization` | `Anonimization techniques`, `Access data management`, `Document access requirement of external partners`, `` | All case operational in mandalo startup. | `Logical Data model`, `Conceptual Data model`, `Access and Authorization management`, `Technical document of business requirement`, `Data arquictecture model` | `Wait to start` |
| 6 | Create a SQL enviroment to share data: implement a data model | Implement a data model to physical level to data sharing enviroment in postgresql. This is used in mandalo startup. | `Data sharing`, `Data model` | `Access data management`, `Data modeling` | case #5 |  `Physical Data model`, `SQL Script postgresql` | `Wait to start` | 
| 7 | Integrated deletion data of logistic | Implement a POC to delete sensistived data for user based in logistic system. | `Deleted data`, `Data Inventory`, `Data model`, `Data mapping` | `Data modeling`, `Data inventory`, `Data architecture`| None | `Data architecture diagram`, `Data Inventory system docs`, `POC system` | `Wait to start` |
